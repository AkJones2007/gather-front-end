### Application Summary
Gather is a web application that allows users to connect with their friends on the fly. Whether it's a night out on the town, or a casual house party, Gather allows users to create events, or "Gatherings", and invite people to join. Users can also create "open" gatherings to organize public events that anyone can attend.
